## Installation

You can install `netR` from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BenaroyaResearch/netR")
```

## Repository

Repository uses Github Actions and codecov. See badges above.


### renv

`renv` is an R package for dependency management. [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html)
helps keep same versions of packages used for all collaborators. <br/>
It is encouraged to keep `netR` dependencies as few as possible (0 dependency 
and light-weight `data.table` for data manipulation is recommended).


### GitHub Actions

There are 2 workflows in GH Actions: `R-CMD-check` and `test-coverage`. <br/>

After each push to the remote repository, automated checks are performed. 
`R CMD Check` runs all package unit tests and checks if the package can be 
installed on most popular platforms - MacOS, Windows and Linux.
<br/>

Code coverage reports are generated for `main` branch only.


### Code coverage

To measure test coverage of `netR` codebase, `covr` package is used (See 
workflows in GitHub Actions). 


### Readme

This Readme is generated from `README.Rmd`. To update this file, modify `.Rmd` 
file  in the package and rebuild using: <br/>
`devtools::build_readme()` or knit `README.Rmd` - `Cmd + Shift + Enter` 
(Windows `Ctrl + Shift + Enter`).


## Development workflow

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/BenaroyaResearch/netR.git`

2. Create a development branch with name indicating what changes the branch 
is going to introduce - `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
  
3. Open `netR.Rproj` file and call `renv::restore()`. This updates packages
versions to the ones that are specified in `renv.lock` file. If needed, packages
will be installed. This applies only to the `netR` project on your machine. If 
you need to install and use another package, use `install.packages()` and then 
update `renv.lock` file using `renv::snapshot()` (so the next person can 
`renv::resotre()`). If you face troubles installing packages when using `renv`,
you might need change the download method with 
`Sys.setenv(RENV_DOWNLOAD_METHOD = "libcurl")` for `libcurl` or `wininet`.

4. Add `.R` file with a new function(s) or add to an existing file

5. Add unit tests (recommended)

6. Run `devtools::document()` to update functions' `man` files and `NAMESPACE`,  
`devtools::test()` to run your unit test and check if they all pass and 
`devtools::check()` to run `R CMD check` locally. If unit tests and cmd-check is 
not run locally, it will be run by GitHub anyway.

6. Increment version in `DESCRIPTION` file and add new line to `ver_log.md` file.
If this is your first contribution to the package, remember to add yourself 
to `Author` field in `DESCRIPTION` file.

7. Push your code to remote: `git push -u origin <branch_name>`

8. Open a _Pull Request_ for your branch. After passing `R-CMD-check` and
getting approval from other collaborator, merge your development branch into
`main`


### Merging into main branch
  
`main` is a _protected_ branch, meaning that you cannot push directly to it. To
merge code you should create a _pull request_ from your development branch. At
least one reviewer needs to approve your _PR_ to be able to merge into `main`.
<br/> All required GitHub Actions workflows must pass (`R-CMD-check`). This
prevents merging not working/incompatible code into `main`.


### Unit tests

Package uses `testthat` for unit testing. <br/>
Tested functions are encouraged - when working with networks it is sometimes 
easy to introduce a bug. Assertions of what we think a function does and what 
actually happens is easier when using unit tests.


### Versioning

[Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) is used. In short: <br/>
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g. `0.2.1`) <br/>
`MAJOR` - for incompatible changes that possibly break existing code <br/>
`MINOR` - adding new functions to the package <br/>
`PATCH` - bug fixes and minor changes <br/>


### Code of conduct

1. All contributors are welcome
2. We are kind
